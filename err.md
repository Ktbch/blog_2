# errors 
ERROR: relation "post" does not exist
ERROR: sequleize based error the column "create_at" was not found

# reasoan for the error
REASON: It was the order i created the files
REASON: I already change the default createdAt and updatedAt generated by the sequlize-cli model:generate migrations file to updated_at and created_at

# fix 
Fix: I had to recreate the migration file comment
Fix: I have had this error before so i copied my code and pasted on chatgpt and scaned the code then gave me a fix. 
     so the fix goes like this i navigated into my comments model generated by seqeulize and added in the comment init section underscore:true
